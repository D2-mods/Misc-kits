---

KENSAIZERKER: A variant of the kensai, or "sword saint", this warrior is in tune with <PRO_HISHER> animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable <PRO_HIMHER> to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to.

Components:
-
1. Install kits
2. Choose Enrage version (options in installer)
3. Kit Updater (see below)

--

**Install notes:**
- config.ini: Set a kit to = 0 to prevent install
- Updater and Enrage components can be re-run at any time.
- Install after class revisions, except for Talents of Faerun. If another revision says to install after all kit mods, you can try it both ways.
- Safe to install before or after most tweak mods, including proficiency revisions. It's still recommended to follow normal install order guidelines.

**Kit Updater:**
- Updates HLA tables, Proficiencies, misc fixes, mod compat, etc.
- Monastery Swordsman: Can put max slots in any melee weapon usable by base Monk.
- Run after all tweak and overhaul mods, including mods that say to install last.
- Dual to Kit note: Run this once before Dual to Kit if using a proficiency tweak. It can be re-run after if you need to update other things later. (note: it's specifically component 3 of Dual to Kit that needs to be after any proficiency edits)

**Talents of Faerun notes:**
- Run the Updater after ToF. This is **REQUIRED** for compatibility.
- Jesterblade can select Blade-only abilities at same level as Blade. If ToF selectable songs are detected, the Jesterblade song will also have a song switching ability.
- Monastery Swordsman can learn some fighter abilities at same level as fighter. It has access to all fighter HLAs, in addition to most monk ones.
